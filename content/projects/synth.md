description : A Sketch for a VST plugin using javascript

---

I decided to try to build a VST plugin. Mostly I wanted to do it as a challange for building Ui with Vue.js. Then I also tried to actualy make the Synth produce sound with both Tone.js and Elemantary.js, but I only partly succeded in that. The result for now is not fully functional from a sound-design perspective but it does produce *some* sort of sound.
it was built using Vue.js and Elementary.js.
